/**
 * This class is responsible for calculating AI's next move and then returning
 * it when asked for next move. All values are measured in centipawns that is
 * one hundredth of pawn's value. Uses negamax sped up with alpha-beta pruning
 * and transposition tables. Alpha-beta pruning also is sped up by principal
 * variation and killer move heuristics. Also tests captures before positional
 * moves.
